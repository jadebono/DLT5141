## `IDEs`

An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is a software application that provides a comprehensive set of tools for software developers to write, test, debug, and maintain code. IDEs are designed to improve the productivity of developers by offering several features and tools within a single interface. Some of the common features and tools found in IDEs include:

1. Code Editor: A text editor specifically designed for writing and editing source code. It often includes features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and line numbering to help developers write code more efficiently.
1. Compiler and/or Interpreter: IDEs often come with built-in tools to translate high-level source code into machine code or bytecode. This allows developers to build and run their applications directly from the IDE.
1. Debugger: A tool that helps developers identify and fix errors in their code. It allows them to set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variables and memory.
1. Version Control Integration: Many IDEs integrate with version control systems like Git, allowing developers to track changes, commit code, and collaborate with others directly from the IDE.
1. Project Management: Tools to manage and organize files, resources, and dependencies related to a software project.
1. Intelligent Code Assistance: Features like auto-completion, code suggestions, and refactoring tools that help developers write code more quickly and with fewer errors.
1. Build Automation Tools: Tools that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software.
1. Integrated Testing Tools: Facilities for writing, running, and debugging tests directly within the IDE.
1. Graphical User Interface (GUI) Designers: Tools that allow developers to design and prototype user interfaces visually.
1. Extensions and Plugins: Many IDEs allow developers to install additional tools and features to customize their development environment.

## `Microsoft Visual Studio Code`

A popular choice of IDE is Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (often referred to as VS Code) is free. It is an open-source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, and macOS. The source code for VS Code is available on GitHub under the MIT License.

**Note:** Though VS Studio Code is free, it comes with telemetry/tracking. If this is an issue for you, you should install VS Codium which is identical to Microsoft's VS Code but does not contain tracking.

Download and install your choice of IDE:

- [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [VS Codium](https://vscodium.com/)

More about telemetry:
If you're using VS Code, you can disable telemetry for it and for its extensions in this manner:

1. Open settings by clicking on file => preferences => settings;
1. search for telemetry in the search bar at the top of the settings screen;
1. Disable any telemetry settings that you do not want.

## `Useful Extensions`

Extensions (also sometimes referred to as plugins or add-ons) are additional pieces of software that can be added to the core program to provide new features, capabilities, or integrations that aren't present in the base application. Extensions are very useful as they extend the capabilities of VS Code in any way you please.

To install extensions:

1. Click on the extensions icon in the vertical sidebar on the left side of the window;
1. Search for the desired extension in the search bar that becomes available;
1. Click on install;

For the purposes of this course, students are advised to install the following extensions (copy and paste in the extension search bar):

1. Live Server;
1. Path Intellisense;
1. Prettier - Code Formatter;
1. Auto Rename Tag;
1. CSS Peek;
1. ES Lint;
1. JavaScript (ES6) code snippets;
1. vscode-icons;
1. Babel JavaScript;
1. HTML CSS Support;
